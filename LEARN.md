## How I Built This Project

1. **Project Initialization**
   - Created a new Python project for my UAS (final project) in Digital Image Processing course.
   - Set up a virtual environment and initialized a Git repository.

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Added dependencies: Flask, OpenCV (headless), NumPy, Pillow, and Streamlit for cloud deployment.
   - Used `requirements.txt` and `dev-requirements.txt` for easy installation.

3. **Development**
   - Built the main Flask web app in `app.py` for local use.
   - Implemented core image processing features: thresholding, edge detection, and advanced morphological operations.
   - Used Bootstrap for a modern, responsive UI.
   - Sometimes used GitHub Copilot to help write and refactor code faster.

4. **Testing & Debugging**
   - Tested locally on Windows using VS Code.
   - Fixed bugs and improved algorithms iteratively.

5. **Deployment**
   - For local: Run Flask app with `python app.py` or `flask run`.
